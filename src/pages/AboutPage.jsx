        <strong>Countries of the World</strong> is a small multi-page React app
        built for Lab Activity 07 of Front-End Development 2.

      <p>
        The starter you cloned had no routing at all. In this lab you install
        React Router, wire it into the app, and turn this into a real
        multi-page experience with working navigation and a 404 page.
